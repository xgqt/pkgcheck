Positional Arguments
--------------------

:TARGET:  
        optional targets

Config Options
--------------

--config CONFIG_FILE  
                      Load custom pkgcheck scan settings from a given file.
                      
                      Note that custom user settings override all other system and repo-level
                      settings.
                      
                      It's also possible to disable all types of settings loading by
                      specifying an argument of 'false' or 'no'.

Repo Options
------------

-r REPO, --repo REPO  
                      target repo

Reporter Options
----------------

-R REPORTER, --reporter REPORTER  
                                  Select a reporter to use for output.
                                  
                                  Use ``pkgcheck show --reporters`` to see available options.

--format FORMAT_STR               
                                  Custom format string used to format output by FormatReporter.
                                  
                                  Supports python format string syntax where result object attribute names
                                  surrounded by curly braces are replaced with their values (if they exist).
                                  
                                  For example, ``--format '{category}/{package}/{package}-{version}.ebuild``
                                  will output ebuild paths in the target repo for results relating to
                                  specific ebuild versions. If a result is for the generic package (or a
                                  higher scope), no output will be produced for that result.
                                  
                                  Furthermore, no output will be produced if a result object is missing any
                                  requested attribute expansion in the format string. In other words,
                                  ``--format {foo}`` will never produce any output because no result has the
                                  ``foo`` attribute.

Base Options
------------

-h, --help       
                 Show this help message and exit. To get more
                 information see the related man page.

--debug          
                 Enable debug checks and show verbose debug output.

-q, --quiet      
                 Suppress non-error, informational messages.

-v, --verbose    
                 Increase the verbosity of various output.

--color BOOLEAN  
                 Toggle colored output support. This can be used to forcibly
                 enable color support when piping output or other sitations
                 where stdout is not a tty.

Main Options
------------

-f FILTER, --filter FILTER  
                            Support limiting targeted packages for scanning using a chosen filter.
                            
                            If the 'latest' argument is used, only the latest package per slot of
                            both VCS and non-VCS types will be scanned. This can either be
                            specified individually in which case the filter will be applied
                            globally to all checks or it can be applied to specific checksets,
                            checks, or keywords using the syntax 'latest:ObjName' which would apply
                            the filter to the keyword, check, or checkset named ObjName (in that
                            order of precedence).
                            
                            By default, some checks have filtering enabled, e.g. various
                            network-related checks are filtered to avoid redundant or unnecessary
                            server requests. In order to forcibly disable all filtering use the
                            'no' argument.

-j JOBS, --jobs JOBS        
                            Number of checks to run in parallel, defaults to using all available
                            processors.

-t TASKS, --tasks TASKS     
                            Number of asynchronous tasks to run concurrently (defaults to 5 * CPU count).

--cache CACHE               
                            All cache types are enabled by default, this option explicitly sets
                            which caches will be generated and used during scanning.
                            
                            To enable only certain cache types, specify them in a comma-separated
                            list, e.g. ``--cache git,profiles`` will enable both the git and
                            profiles caches.
                            
                            To disable specific cache types prefix them with ``-``. Note
                            that when starting the argument list with a disabled value an equals
                            sign must be used, e.g. ``--cache=-git``, otherwise the disabled
                            argument is treated as an option.
                            
                            In order to disable all cache usage, it's easiest to use ``--cache no``
                            instead of explicitly listing all disabled cache types.
                            
                            When disabled, no caches will be saved to disk and results requiring
                            caches (e.g. git-related checks) will be skipped.

--cache-dir CACHE_DIR       
                            directory to use for storing cache files

--exit [ITEM]               
                            Comma-separated list of checksets, checks, or keywords to enable and
                            disable that trigger an exit status failure. Checkset and check
                            arguments expand into their respective keyword sets.
                            
                            If no arguments or only disabled arguments are passed, enabled
                            arguments are the set of error level keywords.
                            
                            To specify disabled keywords prefix them with ``-``. Also, the special
                            arguments of ``error``, ``warning``, ``style``, and ``info`` correspond
                            to the related keyword groups.

Check Selection
---------------

--net                              
                                   enable checks that require network access

-C CHECKSET, --checksets CHECKSET  
                                   Comma-separated list of checksets to enable and disable for
                                   scanning.
                                   
                                   The special argument of ``all`` corresponds to the list of all checks.
                                   Therefore, to forcibly enable all checks use ``-C all``.
                                   
                                   All network-related checks (which are disabled by default)
                                   can be enabled using ``-C net``. This allows for easily running only
                                   network checks without having to explicitly list them.

-s SCOPE, --scopes SCOPE           
                                   Comma-separated list of scopes to enable and disable for scanning. Any
                                   scopes specified in this fashion will affect the checks that get
                                   run. For example, running pkgcheck with only the repo scope
                                   enabled will cause only repo-level checks to run.
                                   
                                   Available scopes: git, profiles, eclass, repo, cat, pkg, ver

-c CHECK, --checks CHECK           
                                   Comma-separated list of checks to enable and disable for
                                   scanning. Any checks specified in this fashion will be the
                                   only checks that get run, skipping any disabled checks.
                                   
                                   To disable checks prefix them with ``-``. Note that when starting the
                                   argument list with a disabled check an equals sign must be used, e.g.
                                   ``-c=-check``, otherwise the disabled check argument is treated as an
                                   option.
                                   
                                   Additive arguments are also supported using the prefix ``+`` that adds
                                   to the default set of enabled checks. This is useful in order to enable
                                   optional checks in addition to the default set.
                                   
                                   Use ``pkgcheck show --checks`` see all available checks.

-k KEYWORD, --keywords KEYWORD     
                                   Comma-separated list of keywords to enable and disable for
                                   scanning. Any keywords specified in this fashion will be the
                                   only keywords that get reported, skipping any disabled keywords.
                                   
                                   To specify disabled keywords prefix them with ``-``. Note that when
                                   starting the argument list with a disabled keyword an equals sign must
                                   be used, e.g. ``-k=-keyword``, otherwise the disabled keyword argument is
                                   treated as an option.
                                   
                                   The special arguments of ``error``, ``warning``, ``style``, and
                                   ``info`` correspond to the related keyword groups. For example, to only
                                   scan for errors use ``-k error``.
                                   
                                   Use ``pkgcheck show --keywords`` to see available options.

Plugin Options
--------------

--glsa-dir GLSA_DIR   
                      custom glsa directory

--source-arches ARCH  
                      Comma separated list of arches to compare against for
                      lagging stabilization.
                      
                      The default arches are all stable arches (unless --arches is specified).

Arches
------

-a ARCH, --arches ARCH  
                        Comma separated list of arches to enable and disable.
                        
                        To specify disabled arches prefix them with '-'. Note that when
                        starting the argument list with a disabled arch an equals sign
                        must be used, e.g. -a=-arch, otherwise the disabled arch
                        argument is treated as an option.
                        
                        By default all repo defined arches are used; however,
                        stable-related checks (e.g. UnstableOnly) default to the set of
                        arches having stable profiles in the target repo.

Git
---

Git repo support for various checks.

Pkgcheck can create virtual package repos from a given git repo's history
in order to provide more info for checks relating to stable requests,
outdated blockers, or local commits. These virtual repos are cached and
updated every run if new commits are detected.

Git repos must have a supported config in order to work properly.
Specifically, pkgcheck assumes that the origin branch exists and tracks
upstream.

Additionally, the origin/HEAD ref must exist. If it doesn't, running ``git
remote set-head origin master`` or similar for other branches will create
it.

--commits [tree-ish]  
                      Targets are determined from the committed changes compared to a
                      given reference that defaults to the repo's origin.
                      
                      For example, to scan all the packages that have been changed in
                      the current branch compared to the branch named 'old' use
                      ``pkgcheck scan --commits old``. For two separate branches
                      named 'old' and 'new' use ``pkgcheck scan --commits old..new``.

--staged [tree-ish]   
                      Targets are determined using all staged changes for the git
                      repo. Unstaged changes and untracked files are ignored by
                      temporarily stashing them during the scanning process.

Profiles
--------

-p PROFILE, --profiles PROFILE  
                                Comma separated list of profiles to enable and disable for
                                scanning. Any profiles specified in this fashion will be the
                                only profiles that get scanned, skipping any disabled profiles.
                                In addition, if no profiles are explicitly enabled, all
                                profiles defined in the target repo's profiles.desc file will be
                                scanned except those marked as experimental (exp).
                                
                                To specify disabled profiles prefix them with ``-`` which
                                removes the from the list of profiles to be considered. Note
                                that when starting the argument list with a disabled profile an
                                equals sign must be used, e.g.  ``-p=-path/to/profile``,
                                otherwise the disabled profile argument is treated as an
                                option.
                                
                                The special keywords of ``stable``, ``dev``, ``exp``, and
                                ``deprecated`` correspond to the lists of stable, development,
                                experimental, and deprecated profiles, respectively. Therefore,
                                to only scan all stable profiles pass the ``stable`` argument
                                to --profiles. Additionally the keyword ``all`` can be used to
                                scan all defined profiles in the target repo.

Network
-------

--timeout TIMEOUT        
                         timeout used for network checks

--user-agent USER_AGENT  
                         custom user agent spoofing

Query Caching
-------------

--reset-caching-per {version,package,category}  
                                                control how often the cache is cleared (version, package or category)
